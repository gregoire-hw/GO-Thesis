"Multi-domain coordinated motion forautonomous surface and underwater vehicles"

The aim of this project is to model the integration of aiding signals from the USV into thenavigation system of the AUV. This will enable the AUV to know its global position basedon the GPS position of the USV and range-only measurements from the surface.  One wayand two ways communications will be explored.  Also, the use of a sonar from the ASV tolocalise the AUV might be explored.A second objective aims at developing behaviour rules for the vehicles that will allow themto  work  around  an  inspection  target,  taking  into  account  their  physical  and  navigationalconstraints while allowing the AUV to benefit from the external position information.  Theconstraints to respect will be to keep the tether between the USV and the AUV manageableduring the motions.The objectives of this project are to develop multiple strategies to evaluate in terms of robust-ness and stability of the vehiclesâ€™ motion under differing levels of GNSS and communicationsnoise and different environmental conditions.
