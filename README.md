# Multi-domain coordinated motion for autonomous surface and underwater vehicles

*** WORK IN PROGRESS ***

The aim of this project is to model the integration of aiding signals from an USV into the navigation system of an AUV. This will enable the AUV to know its global position based on the GPS position of the USV and range-only measurements from the surface. One way and two ways communications will be explored.
A second objective aims at developing behaviour rules for the vehicles that will allow them to work around an inspection target, taking into account their physical and navigational constraints while allowing the AUV to benefit from the external position information. The constraints to respect will be to keep the tether between the USV and the AUV manageable during the motions.
The objectives of this project are to develop multiple strategies to evaluate in terms of robustness and stability of the vehiclesâ€™ motion under differing levels of GNSS and communications noise and different environmental conditions.
